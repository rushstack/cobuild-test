# heft-sass-test

This project folder is one of the **build-tests** for the [Heft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rushstack/heft)
build system. It illustrates a realistic small project that targets a web browser runtime,
includes the uses of Sass, SCSS, and CSS, and renders using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

The following tasks are configured:

- [TypeScript](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft_tasks/typescript/) compiler
- [ESLint](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft_tasks/eslint/) coding style validator
- [Jest](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft_tasks/jest/) test runner
- [copy-static-assets](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft_tasks/copy-static-assets/) for .css, .scss, and .sass files
- [Webpack](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft_tasks/webpack/) for bundling and optimization

Please see the [Heft documentation](https://rushstack.io/pages/heft/overview/) for documentation and tutorials.
